<h2 >Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">My name is Kate. I am 24 and I have lived in Illinois my whole life. I have one older sister Jessy and one younger sister named Alyssa. My parents names are Kim and Al. My dad works as a network infrastructure designer for Abbvie and my mom is a housemaker. I major in Computer Science, but it took awhile to make this decision. I first started going to school to study business, then shortly decided to study accounting. It was boring and unsatisfying so I finally made the switch to computer science with intention of becoming a programmer/software developer.   </p>
<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul style="font-size: 18px;">
<li>How to work on a project from beginning to end with a team.</li>
<li>How to use GitHub efficiently to manage code with a team.</li>
<li>Create a product from design stages to working software with a team.</li>
<li>Develop better management/organizational skills.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">My favorite hobby is playing music. I have played in a punk rock band Cellar Rats since I was 15. In the band I play bass/guitar and sometimes do vocals. On the side I also play the banjo. Other than music I like to play Fortnite and Zombies with my sister.</p>
<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">A fun fact about myself is that I own two snakes. One is a ball python named Julius. The other is a red-tailed boa constrictor named Scarlet.</p>
